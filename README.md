A Student Management System (SMS) is a software application used to manage and organize student-related information in educational institutions. It helps in storing and accessing student data such as personal details, academic performance, attendance, and fee records. The system streamlines processes like tracking student progress, managing grades, scheduling classes, and generating reports, making it easier for administrators, teachers, and students to manage academic tasks efficiently.
